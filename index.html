        <h1 style="background-color:#00FF6C">History of computers</h1>
        <h2 style="background-color:#00A344">Early mechanical and analog devices</h2>
        <p style="background-color:#E6FFF0">Abacus: Dating back to ancient Babylon, the abacus was one of the first manual calculation tools. 
Pascaline: In 1642, Blaise Pascal invented the first mechanical calculator, which could perform addition. 
Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz: Developed a machine in 1671 that could multiply as well as add. 
Analytical Engine: In the 1830s, Charles Babbage designed the first general-purpose, programmable computer, though it was never fully built in his lifetime. Ada Lovelace, his collaborator, is credited with writing the first algorithm for it. </p>
    <h2 style="background-color:#00A344">The electronic era and WWII</h2>
    <p style="background-color:#E6FFF0">Punch card systems: In 1890, Herman Hollerith created a punch card system to speed up data processing for the U.S. Census. His company would eventually become IBM. 
Z3: Konrad Zuse built the Z3 in Germany in 1941, which is considered by some to be the first working programmable, digital computer. 
WWII and analog computers: The war spurred the development of electronic computers. The Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) was designed to solve simultaneous equations, and the Colossus was used to break codes. 
ENIAC: Built by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, the ENIAC was completed in 1945 and was one of the first electronic general-purpose computers</p>
    <h2 style="background-color:#00A344">Modern Computers</h2>
    <p style="background-color:#E6FFF0">Transistors and integrated circuits: The invention of the transistor in 1947 and the integrated circuit in 1958 allowed for smaller, more powerful, and more energy-efficient computers. 
Microprocessors: Intel's 1971 invention of the microprocessor paved the way for the personal computer revolution. 
Personal computers: The 1970s saw the emergence of microcomputers and the founding of companies like Apple and Microsoft. 
IBM PC: In 1981, IBM launched the IBM PC, which greatly accelerated the growth of the personal computer market. 
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Apple's Lisa (1983) and Macintosh (1984) introduced the first personal computers with a GUI, making computers more accessible to the general public. </p>
